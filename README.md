# LabelsManager
Python 2.7

LabelsManager is a set of tools to automatise simple manipulations and measurements of medical images and images 
segmentations in nifti format.

Each tool provided can be 
* Accessed directly as nibabel objects, numpy arrays and other Python objects.
* Accessed indirectly trough the facades as paths to the corresponding files.


## What can you do with LabelsManager

What can you do with the package labels_manager: access all the functions stored in tools, programmed to work with numpy array, using the facade manager that works with paths to nifti images. 
Tools consists of simple manipulations of labels, mainly based on [NiftySeg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftySeg_install) and [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg_install).
The visualisation software preferred is [ITK-snap](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Downloads.SNAP3).

Examples of tools are divided in:
* Cutter: cut each timepoint of a 4d volumes with the same 3d mask
* Merger: to stack images an to merge labels stored in a 4d volume to a 3d one.
* Splitter: opposite direction as merger.
* Relabeller: change the values of the labels according to given permutation or labels lists.
* Symmetriser: symmetrise a segmentation from one side to the anatomical image to the other, by flipping or with rigid or affine registration to compensate for asymmetries.
* Measurements: compute distances between patches (generated with morphological tools).
 Compute the centroid of each label of a segmentation, compute linear measurements, compute volumetric measurements.

The dev branch is devoted to prototyping algorithms and for benchmarking respect to the state of the art segmentation algorithms (NiftySeg).
It currently contains some early developments of label fusion algorithms.

## Instructions
The tools and manager in the code can be installed as a python package on a virtualenv 
(strongly recommended as it is recommended to avoid installing this package on system python interpreter).
It is based on NiftyReg, NiftySeg, ITK-snap and some python (2.7) standard libraries

+ Install [NiftySeg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftySeg_install)
+ Install [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg_install)
+ Install [ITK-snap](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Downloads.SNAP3)

+ Install python requirements in requirements.txt with

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

in a [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

### To use as a package in a virtualenv.

1) activate the virtualenvironment and go in the root folder of the repository.

+ To install as a library (option 1):

`python setup.py sdist`

`cd ../`

`pip install LabelManager/dist/LabelsManager-XX.tar.gz`

where XX is the chosen version.

+ To install as a library (option 2):

`python setup.py install`

+ To install in [development mode](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode) (option 1) 

`python setup.py develop`

+ To install in development mode (option 2)

`pip install -e .`

+ To verify that it works:

`python`

`from labels_manager.main import LabelsManager as LM`

`lm = LM('/some/folder')`

To uninstall:

 `pip uninstall LabelsManager`
 
To delete the library in the virtualenv in case something really wrong happen and pip uninstall will not work correctly:
  
  `sudo rm -rf /path_to_site_packages_in_virtualenv/site-packages/LabelsManager*`
 
## Tests - Nosetest

To check that everything works run `nosetests` in the root directory of the project.

## Design pattern

Command design pattern: 

Tools package stored under labels_manager.tools are designed to manipulate segmentations as numpy.arrays and are tested individually in the test folder.
To make them work directly with nifty images, the class LabelsManager is implemented, with a facade design pattern. 
Under labels_manager/main.py, the class LabelsManager calls the methods stored in the tools package, and it is extended in a has-a relationship with Command design pattern and class composition paradigm 
through the "agents" classes under label_manager.agents. 

An instances of the class LabelsManager access the nifty images through their paths, and apply to their data each of the specified tools. 
 
For example to apply the tool `relabel` under `tools.manipulations.relabel` to the input files `file{1..10}.nii.gz` in the folder `input_folder`
and save the relabelled segmentations in the `output_folder` you can:

```python
lm = LabelsManager(input_folder, output_folder)

for i in range(1, 11):
    input_file_name = 'file{}.nii.gz'.format(i)
    output_file_name = 'file{}.nii.gz'.format(i)
    lm.manipulate.relabel(input_file_name, output_file_name,
                          [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
```


  
## Working examples
To see some toy examples of what can be done with LabelsManager, go to LabelsManager/examples and run simple_relabelling_examples.py after running
run generate_images_examples.py and after selecting the example you want to run in the module itself. Explore other examples as manipulator_example.py.


## Work in progress code - Warning

This code is a constant work in progress. 

How it should work: evey method in the `tools` is as direct as possible and works for nibabel images or
for numpy arrays or for some other type of data, and tested independently.
To apply the methods in the tools to nifti images by their paths, you can access
them via the agents: they provide a facade to the tools method, sharing 
the same path management, that is in itself a tool.

Being a work in progress, there can be methods in `tools` acting directly on paths (ending in `_path`), and
not yet integrated in the agents, and not yet tested. This has to be considered as a temporary method
that will be soon integrated in the existing agents or in some new agents created ad hoc 
(evey method ending in `_path` has to be seen as a todo and as something that will be soon replaced).
